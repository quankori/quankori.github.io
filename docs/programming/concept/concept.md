## Process

A Process is a program running on the system. Each process has its own memory address space, and processes cannot access each other's memory. When a program is executed, it creates a new process on the system. Each process can contain multiple threads.

## Thread

A Thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. Each thread shares the same memory address space as its parent process and can access the process's variables and resources. Each thread can execute a specific task and uses the CPU to execute instructions.
