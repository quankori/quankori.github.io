In the field of computer science and algorithms, "Data Structures" are the way data is organized and stored in computer memory to make accessing, manipulating, and managing data efficient and convenient. Data structures provide a means to represent objects, information, or collections of data in an organized form, facilitating efficient operations such as searching, sorting, inserting, deleting, and many others.

There are two types of Data Structures:

**Linear Data Structures** These are data structures in which elements are arranged in a linear order and have one element before and one element after (except for the first and last elements). These structures typically follow a linear model and can be traversed from beginning to end.

Examples of linear data structures include: Array, Linked List, Stack and Queue

**Non-Linear Data Structures** These are data structures that do not follow a linear model, and elements are not arranged in a specific order. These structures often describe non-linear relationships between elements.

Examples of non-linear data structures include:

**Tree**: Has a hierarchical structure with a root node and child nodes.
**Graph**: Consists of vertices and edges connecting vertices, which can be directed or undirected.
**Trie**: A data structure for storing and searching vocabularies, commonly used in natural language processing.
**Hash** Table: A data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to values in the table.
