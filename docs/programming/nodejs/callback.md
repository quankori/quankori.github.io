title: Callbacks in Node.js
---

## Concept

Callbacks are fundamental to asynchronous programming in Node.js. They allow for non-blocking operations, which can greatly improve performance for I/O-bound tasks. However, due to potential callback nesting, it's essential to be aware of and manage callback hell, using patterns or newer language features to ensure maintainable and readable code.
