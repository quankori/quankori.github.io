## Lifecycle

S3 Lifecycle is a feature of Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service), the cloud storage service, that allows users to automatically transition S3 objects between different storage classes over the lifecycle of those objects, depending on their age. This feature helps optimize cost and storage efficiency for S3 objects.

S3 Lifecycle is designed to reduce storage costs by automatically moving objects to different storage classes, such as transitioning from the Standard class to Infrequent Access or Glacier. This reduces costs for storing data that is not frequently accessed over long periods.

S3 Lifecycle rules are defined by two components: "actions" and "transitions." Actions are used to perform operations on objects, such as moving them to a different storage class. Transitions are used to configure when, after an object is created, it will be moved to a different storage class.

With S3 Lifecycle, users can automatically transition objects to different storage classes to reduce storage costs and optimize storage performance. It also helps in managing data on AWS S3 more easily and efficiently.

## Versioning

S3 Versioning is a feature of Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service), a cloud storage service, that allows users to store multiple versions of objects in the same location. With S3 Versioning, every time an object is modified or deleted, a new version of that object is created and retained. This feature helps protect your data from accidental loss due to user deletions or modifications.

When Versioning is enabled on an S3 bucket, any changes or deletions to objects will result in the creation of a new version of that object. Each version of the object has a unique identifier known as a "version ID." This version ID can be used to access different versions of the object or to restore deleted versions.

With S3 Versioning, you can:

- Protect data from user deletions or modifications.
- Track and manage different versions of objects.
- Restore deleted versions.

However, S3 Versioning can also increase storage costs because each version is stored separately. Therefore, when using this feature, you need to manage your stored data carefully to avoid unnecessary cost increases.

In summary, S3 Versioning is a feature of AWS S3 that allows users to store multiple versions of objects in one location, safeguarding data and managing versions of objects.

## Origin Access Identity

Origin Access Identity (OAI) is a feature provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows you to create an Identity-Based Policy for resources within an Amazon S3 bucket. OAI enables you to create an Identity-Based Policy for an Amazon S3 bucket, restricting access rights to the resources of the bucket only to requests made from a CloudFront distribution. This helps secure resources within your Amazon S3 bucket by limiting access rights to requests originating from a CloudFront distribution.

## Sticky Sessions

Sticky sessions are a mechanism in load balancing used to ensure that HTTP requests from a specific client are consistently routed to the same server within a server pool for a predefined period.

When sticky sessions are enabled, a cookie is generated and attached to each HTTP request from the client. The load balancer then uses the information in this cookie to determine which server should handle the next HTTP request from that client. This helps minimize fragmentation and optimize the user experience.

However, using sticky sessions can also lead to uneven load distribution among servers in the server pool, especially when some clients generate more HTTP requests than others, which can reduce the overall system performance. It's essential to carefully consider when and how to use sticky sessions to strike a balance between session persistence and load distribution.

## Object Lock

S3 Object Lock is a feature of Amazon S3 designed to ensure the integrity and compliance of objects stored in S3. This feature allows users to "lock" objects in S3 to prevent them from being unintentionally deleted, modified, or overwritten.

There are two modes of object locking: Governance and Compliance. The Governance mode enables the application of lock policies and the establishment of retention periods for objects in S3, while the Compliance mode creates a "permanent lock" environment for S3 objects.

A retention period is the minimum amount of time an S3 object must be retained before it can be deleted or modified. This period is determined by the lock mode and can only be modified by an AWS administrator. Legal Hold allows users to apply a "permanent lock" to an S3 object, ensuring its legal integrity, and can only be removed with the approval of an AWS administrator.

## AWS Athena

- **Purpose**: Serverless interactive query service.
- **Description**: Enables querying data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL without any servers to manage.
- **Use case**: Analyzing logs, ad-hoc data exploration, complex joins across large datasets.
- **Example**: Analyzing web server logs stored in an S3 bucket to understand user behavior.
- **Key features**:
  - Serverless architecture
  - Pay-per-query pricing
  - Integrates with AWS Glue Data Catalog
  - Supports complex data types (like arrays and maps)
  - Built on Presto with standard SQL support

## S3 Select & S3 Query

- **Purpose**: Extract specific data from S3 objects.
- **Description**: Allows retrieval of a subset of data from an object in S3 using simple SQL expressions without having to retrieve the entire object.
- **Use case**: Simplifying applications by eliminating unnecessary data retrieval, improving performance and reducing costs.
- **Example**: Retrieving specific columns from a CSV file stored in S3.
- **Key features**:
  - Reduces the amount of data transferred
  - Works directly on data stored in S3
  - Supports CSV, JSON, and Parquet data formats
  - Can be used from the AWS Management Console, SDK, or CLI
  - Integrates with other AWS services like Lambda and Athena
