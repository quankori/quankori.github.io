## Lifecycle

The S3 Lifecycle is a feature of the Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) cloud storage service that allows users to automatically transition S3 objects to different storage classes throughout their lifecycle, depending on the age of the objects. This feature helps to optimize storage costs and efficiency for S3 objects.

The S3 Lifecycle is designed to reduce storage costs by automatically transitioning objects to different storage classes, such as from the Standard class to the Infrequent Access or Glacier class. This reduces costs for storing data that isn't necessary over the long term.

S3 Lifecycle rules are defined by two components: "action" and "transition." Actions are used to perform operations on objects, such as transitioning to a different storage class. Transitions are used to configure when, after an object is created, it will be moved to another storage class.

With the S3 Lifecycle, users can automatically transition objects to different storage classes to reduce storage costs and optimize storage performance. It also makes managing data on AWS S3 easier and more efficient.

## Versioning

S3 Versioning is a feature of Amazon's S3 cloud storage service (Simple Storage Service) that allows users to store multiple versions of objects in the same location. With S3 Versioning, every time an object is modified or deleted, a new version of that object is created and stored. This feature helps protect your data from accidental loss due to user deletions or modifications.

When Versioning is enabled on an S3 bucket, any modifications or deletions of an object will result in a new version of that object. Each version of the object has a unique identifier, known as the "version ID". This version ID can be used to access the versions of the object or restore deleted versions.

With S3 Versioning, you can:

- Protect data from user deletions or modifications.
- Track and manage different versions of objects.
- Restore deleted versions.

However, S3 Versioning can also increase storage costs since every version is stored separately. Therefore, when using this feature, you need to manage the stored data closely to avoid unnecessary cost increases.

In summary, S3 Versioning is an AWS S3 feature that allows users to store multiple versions of objects in one location, safeguarding data and managing object versions.

## Origin Access Identity

Origin Access Identity (OAI) is a feature provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows the creation of an Identity-Based Policy for resources within an Amazon S3 bucket. OAI lets you create an Identity-Based Policy for an Amazon S3 bucket, restricting access to the bucket's resources only to requests made from a CloudFront distribution. This helps secure your resources in the Amazon S3 bucket by limiting access to only those requests coming from a CloudFront distribution.

## Sticky Sessions

Sticky sessions are a mechanism in load balancing used to ensure that requests from a specific user are always directed to the same server in a group of active servers (server pool) for a predetermined amount of time.

When sticky sessions are activated, a cookie is generated and attached to each of the user's requests. The load balancer then uses the information in this cookie to determine which server should handle the next request from that user. This ensures that all requests from that user are directed to the same server, minimizing data fragmentation and optimizing the user experience.

However, using sticky sessions can lead to uneven load distribution among servers in the pool, especially when certain users generate more requests than others, which can reduce the overall system performance.

## Object Lock

S3 Object Lock is a feature of Amazon S3 designed to ensure the integrity and legality of objects stored in S3. It allows users to lock S3 objects, preventing them from accidental deletion, modification, or overwriting.

There are two object locking modes: Governance and Compliance. The Governance mode lets users apply lock policies and set retention periods for S3 objects, while the Compliance mode creates a permanent lock environment for S3 objects.

The Retention Period is the minimum time an S3 object must be retained before it can be deleted or modified. It's determined by the lock mode and can only be changed by an AWS administrator. The Legal Hold allows users to impose a permanent lock on an S3 object, ensuring its legal integrity, and can only be lifted with the approval of an AWS administrator.

## AWS Athena

- **Purpose**: Serverless interactive query service.
- **Description**: Enables querying data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL without any servers to manage.
- **Use case**: Analyzing logs, ad-hoc data exploration, complex joins across large datasets.
- **Example**: Analyzing web server logs stored in an S3 bucket to understand user behavior.
- **Key features**:
  - Serverless architecture
  - Pay-per-query pricing
  - Integrates with AWS Glue Data Catalog
  - Supports complex data types (like arrays and maps)
  - Built on Presto with standard SQL support

## S3 Select & S3 Query

- **Purpose**: Extract specific data from S3 objects.
- **Description**: Allows retrieval of a subset of data from an object in S3 using simple SQL expressions without having to retrieve the entire object.
- **Use case**: Simplifying applications by eliminating unnecessary data retrieval, improving performance and reducing costs.
- **Example**: Retrieving specific columns from a CSV file stored in S3.
- **Key features**:
  - Reduces the amount of data transferred
  - Works directly on data stored in S3
  - Supports CSV, JSON, and Parquet data formats
  - Can be used from the AWS Management Console, SDK, or CLI
  - Integrates with other AWS services like Lambda and Athena
