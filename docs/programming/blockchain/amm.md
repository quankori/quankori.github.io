- The AMM algorithm has the formula x \* y = k.
- For example:
  - We have a pool containing 50 BUSD tokens and 50 KORI tokens.
  - According to the formula, we have 50 \* 50 = 2500.
  - John adds 5 BUSD to the pool.
  - Now the pool will be 55 \* 50 = 2750.
  - To achieve the initial value of k which is 2500, we have to pay a corresponding amount of SHIT.
  - KORI received: 50 - (2500 / 55) = 4.54 KORI.
  - Now the pool will be 55 \* 45.46 = 2500, which is equal to the initial k value.
