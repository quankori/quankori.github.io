## Concept

It is a system that executes pre-programmed contracts without the need for intermediaries, however, still requires fees (gas fees) to execute transactions as well as rewards for miners.

Interactions with contracts are done through transactions.

The blockchain only stores a history trail and does not store data.

## Structure

Hash, previous hash, data, nonce

Previous hash + data + nonce + block id + hash algorithm = hash sent to node

The genesis block (first block), previous hash will be 00000000

The nonce is the number of successful transactions performed by the user, the miner will search for nonce until it matches the hash code generated by the system

In blockchain, SHA256 hashes the data and it is a one-way encryption.

The hash code will be compiled into a decimal number (hexadecimal to decimal).

## Characteristics

The avalanche effect: when a small change is made, the hash will create a completely different one from the original hash.

Must withstand collisions. Byzantine Fault Tolerance

- Immutable ledger.

- Advantages over traditional certification.

- Distributed P2P network.

- When a block is added to the network, it will be updated throughout the network (Consensus Protocol).

It can be hacked if 51% is obtained, but it will be very costly.

If a node in the network is hacked, all other nodes will restore that node to its original value.

When a miner successfully adds a block to the chain, the remaining nodes in the network will update accordingly.

However, one of the drawbacks of short block mining time is that there will be many miners who find a block in very close time periods, but only the earliest found block is added to the main branch and slower blocks are abandoned, called orphaned blocks.
