title: Blockchain Trilemma
---

This is a term used to indicate that only two out of three elements can be executed and will easily fail if all three elements are attempted to be carried out at the same time.

The blockchain's infeasible triad includes: Scalability, Security, and Decentralization.

- Decentralization: providing a hierarchical and auditable ecosystem that anyone can participate in without affecting the system.

- Scalability: the ability to handle situations where millions of internet users participate in the network.

- Security: able to defend against attacks such as DDoS, Sybil (the origin of 51% attack),...

Currently, Bitcoin and Ethereum are designed for Decentralization and Security, which affects Scalability.

Ripple, on the other hand, is designed for Security and Scalability, while in terms of Decentralization, they will decide who will participate in the network.
