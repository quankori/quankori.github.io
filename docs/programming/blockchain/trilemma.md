title: Blockchain Trilemma
---

The term used to indicate that only two out of three elements can be achieved, and attempting to achieve all three simultaneously can easily lead to failure.

The three elements that cannot be satisfied simultaneously in blockchain are: Decentralization, Security, and Scalability.

**Decentralization**: Provides a hierarchical and verifiable ecosystem that anyone can participate in without affecting the system.

**Scalability**: The ability to handle situations in which millions of internet users participate in the network.

**Security**: The ability to defend against attacks such as DDoS, Sybil (the origin of the 51% attack),...

Currently, Bitcoin and Ethereum are designed for Decentralization and Security, which affects Scalability.

On the other hand, Ripple is designed for Security and Scalability, while in terms of Decentralization, they decide who will participate in the network.
