### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Encapsulation: Bundling data with methods that operate on that data.
- Inheritance: Creating new classes from existing ones to promote code reuse.
- Polymorphism: Allowing objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, enabling flexibility.
- Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only necessary parts.

### Stateless / Stateful

- Stateless: The server does not retain any information about the client between requests. Each request is independent and contains all necessary information.
- Stateful: The server maintains context or state about the client across multiple requests, allowing for persistent interactions.

### Process / Thread

- Process: An independent program in execution with its own memory space. Processes are isolated from each other, providing stability and security.
- Thread: The smallest unit of processing within a process, sharing the same memory space. Threads allow concurrent execution within a process, enabling parallelism.
